# 📝 Paul Reitz — Personal Blog

Welcome to my digital space — a personal blog built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, hosted on GitHub Pages.

I use this blog to think out loud, share insights, and document ideas around data science, technology, and building systems with impact.
